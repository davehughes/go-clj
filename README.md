My spirit quest to write a LISP interpreter with some cool features and learn a lot about Clojure (and other LISPs) in the process.

Shout-outs to:
--------------
* [Rich Hickey](https://github.com/richhickey) and the Clojure community, who perpetually inspire me with their ideas and artifacts.
* The [pigeon](https://github.com/mna/pigeon) parser generator, which makes parsing a breeze.
* [Mike McLoughlin](https://github.com/mmcloughlin) who [nerd-sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) me into this project.
